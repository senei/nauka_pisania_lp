#_Given enough time_ I can create anything __that you desire__

I am a front-end-developer, sometimes web designer, seo analyst ewen and recently most often the administrator.

At work I like to have everything organized. Each project should be implemented fully because every time when we leave something for the next update it going to haunt us.

As a human I can describe myself as a lonely ghost.

You could say that I have original mind and great drive for implementing my ideas and achieving my goals.

I have tendensy for noticing patterns in work events and develop long-range perspectives.

When committed, I organize my job and carry it through. Skeptical and independent, I have high standards of competence and performance â€“ for myself and others.

Application architecture/design at the existing systems, function and unit levels for Web-based application systems in multi-tier environments.

Application programming for Web-enabled and client-server systems using Java J2EE, JSP, Servlets, JavaScript, PHP, C++, PL/SQL, SQL stored procedures, HTML and others in a variety of integrated development environments.

Web and graphic design using Adobe Photoshop, Macromedia Flash, hand-coded HTML5 and advanced CSS3 techniques. Design projects varied from corporate identity and professional web application interfaces, to public entertainment and e-commerce websites.

Data modeling and database design, structure integration, deployment and administration using MySQL and PostgreSQL. Databases ranged in size from simple to complex tables that covered data migration width activities for conversion.

## What I've Done? _In resent year_.

In 2013, I had plenty of micro-projects to be done at short notice.

From them I can distinguish one significant, strefa-dzieci games of bazgroszyt.pl portal. Which I was administreiting at that time. Usually not quite as it should or could be.
